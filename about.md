Hi, I'm Cloudy, the little monster. I'm a BSc in-progress at the University of Calgary.  

I guess I could currently call myself a junior full-stack developer. I like developing projects and doing everything. I've touched different languages and I knew things a little bit.  

I could've listed all the languages/techniques I knew here, but that would be too many, and none of them is what I really really really proficient in, so that's pointless. Saying you know everything is saying you know nothing, after all. But I would say I can build you a whole website or a web-based application. (Pay me so I can do your coding assignments for you. Lol, jk)

Please follow me on Github and star my repos, thanks lol.

### Okay so you want know more about me??

Then you're going to read something that's totally from my self-awareness. You don't have to, if you're not interested at all. Correct me if I know wrong about myself, I want to know more too.

I'm shy, introvert and insecure to people I don't know. And my insecurity would reach the maximum when in a group of 5 to 10. You might or might not feel I'm in this way, this is because I'm overcoming my nature. But as long as we know each other and I feel secure, we could talk and laugh and do everything like the best. 

I'm also passive on making friends, so I don't have many friends. Kinda lonely but I'm used to it, so that's fine. I'm happy to have new friends though (you be the proactive one, that's been said).

I listen to music a lot. A lot. When I code I wear headphones, when I walk I wear headphones, when I eat I wear headphones, and when I sleep I wear headphones. I mostly listen to electronic dance music (EDM) and pop music, something alone those lines, but I would still say I have a niche taste compare to my friends, not the genre but the artist though, because none of my friends listen to what I listen, sadly. Just appreciating different music. I might share a playlist of my favourite ones, I know nobody cares but I just post them for fun.

My classmate from high school once said I'm a potential gay. I mean, it's not wrong, attractive humans are attractive regardless of the gender, every boy is a potential gay and every girl is a potential lesbian, there's nothing wrong with any sexual orientation. But first of all, I'll be faithful to my girlfriend.

I would like to know some philosophy and psychology. They make you see the world differently and make you think, aren't they.

I'm thinking more graphically than logically. Under unexpected circumstances I would easily get emotional, which is a weakness that I should overcome. I'm trying to be more logical so it can balence the graphical. Not scientifically proved at all, but in people's word, I'm right-brain dominated.

I enjoy arts. I like things that are aesthetic. I enjoy designing UI and UX because I want my projects to have that aesthetic looking as well. 

I have some sort of perfectionism, and I'm working on it too. 

Keep updating...
