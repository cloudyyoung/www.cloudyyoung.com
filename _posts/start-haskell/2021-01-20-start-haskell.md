Last semester, Fall 2020, I took CPSC 329 and learned different programming paradigms. There's one language called Haskell interests me. It's a functional language and I've never touched this type of language before and it looked fun. So I was talking to my friends saying, oh it's an interesting language and I could self-learn it when I have time (aka. Just gonna think about it and never learn it). And this semester, Winter 2021, I'm taking CPSC 449 which is exactly talking about Programming Paradigm, and it's learning Haskell.

Now I'm forced to learn Haskell. What is my mouth.

I'm a newbie to Haskell. Well, it really is a completely different language (or should I say functional programming in general), the syntax and grammar and the way of thinking; all my past programming experiences are not gonna be helpful for Haskell at all, and I'm freaked out a little bit; it is not fun at all. Getting hard times.

On the way of learning it, so far, I discovered something and I would like to share them.

## 1. It really requires you to think recursively

There's no for loop or while loop for you to use, none. Then the only way to enumerate a list or whatever is to use recursive functions. This gets me when problems are complex. We have to really know what we're coding, distinguish the base cases and inductive steps clearly, otherwise we'll easily get lost in our many many thoughts.

(Trying out some techniques and hopefully I can update it here later)

## 2. Learn the grammar

I'm just confused with the grammar to be honest, so we should read a textbook. Indentation matters; though you could use tabs and still compile but GHCI would complain, spaces are preferred, and no mixed-up. 

## 3. Academic not Industrial

Haskell is so handy for solving mathematical problems. With [Taxes Ranges](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#texas-ranges), you can easily turn a complex formula or function into one line of code. 

However, I really cannot image if Haskell is wildely used for industrial purpose, because each single function would just doing limited things and they're in pieces, and we don't have loops to use too. What I feel is it would be a pain in the ass. You might still use it, like Facebook uses Haskell for contect inspection, but you wouldn't use it like you use Java or Python, obviously.

By the way [Carnap](https://github.com/Carnap/Carnap) is written in Haskell too. I love Carnap!  

Ok, that's basically what I wanted to say. Uh, how should I end this though.
