Okay. So the last blog in Wordpress was broken. I deleted all the posts intentionally in that blog, so there was nothing left; and after a while I accidently erased the server, the blog was then completely broken. I just hate Wordpress making everything complicated by carrying way more features than I need. And I don't want people coming to my website and seeing a broken one saying the error.   

So this one, the turned new leaf, is based on Github Pages, and as well as Jekyll. It feels great to have this simple, git-based and minimalism new blog to get started with.  

Again, I just generally don't like writing, so I really don't know if I will post anything here after this one. Likely, this will become a place where I save some of my notes for programming. We'll see.
